CVRS radio club organised a group buy and construction project to build the [Kanga Kits PT20 portable morse tutor]([PT20 Portable Morse Tutor](https://www.kanga-products.co.uk/ourshop/prod_7633790-PT20-Portable-Morse-Tutor.html)).

This device generates random letters, callsigns, numbers or prosigns depending on the mode. Words per minute, spacing, pitch and volume can be adjusted. It is a neat little kit ideal for a first project if your interested in learning morse code.
